Ansible Vagrant files
This repository contains a collection of my virtual machines running various applications. The VMs are created via Vagrant and provisioned via Ansible.


All of these examples use a combination of roles I've added to Ansible Galaxy, and were created to help demonstrate Ansible's simplicity and flexibility.
